110 Difference Between Session and Cache

        Some key differences between cache and session in Laravel:

    1 Scope: Cache is global, mening that it is available to all users of the application. Session, on the other hand, 
        is spefific to a user's session, and the data is only availableto that user.

    2 Accessibility: Chache can be accessed from anywhere in the application, while session data is only available to the user's session.

    3 Performance: Cache is generally faster than session, since it is stored in memory or in a cache store, 
        which are faster than a database.
